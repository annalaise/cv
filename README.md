A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.

I'm an ex product owner, and have become so fascinated with understanding *how* to build brilliant applications (as well as the *why*) that I've switched careers to enroll in a developer bootcamp, Maker's Academy.


When the 16 week course ends, I'll be seeking a role as junior full stack developer. Maker's Academy place a great deal of emphasis on clean, reusable code, TDD and collaboration - I'd like to work in an environment that echoes these values.

## Skills

#### Product and commercial experience

My early career was spent in marketing and eCommerce roles, in the complex world of Financial Services. Since 2013, I have led digital product teams at Experian and latterly, M&S.com. In the last 7 months (to help fund my Maker's studies), I've had my freelance hat on, providing product consultancy to Nando's on optimising their online takeaway journeys and overhauling their site UI. A small selection of things I'm proud of from these times:

- Helped Nando's to understand the full potential of their eCommerce opportunities. During my contract, I led the redesign of the takeaway site to make it mobile responsive, redesigned the site navigation and lead an extensive project to map the takeaway ordering journey for customers. Overall, this work increased online takeaway orders by 8%.

- Leveled up my technical knowledge as the Product Owner of the M&S mobile website (a Ruby Sinatra app). We focused on improving site UX, performance and stability, using multiple cloud environments, TDD and continuous delivery. I learnt a vast amount from an incredible team of people. Most notably, the importance of the right culture, practices and environment for the team to build clean, elegant code that never failed in production, and gave users a delightful (and super fast) browsing experience.

For a time, all of these experiences provided a mental challenge. However, it's gotten easier to understand user problems and come up with solutions - and as an INTJ, I'm most comfortable when things aren't easy. It's time to combine my existing skill set with a more technical career that has infinite opportunities for learning and challenge.

## Interests

In play, as in work, I love to learn new things. For 2017, my learning goals are:
- Piano: pass Grade 1 (end goal: play something by Ludovico Einaudi)
- Knitting: make myself a jumper (with optional side-quest: planning the pattern in Ruby)

When not filling my brain with new things, I'll likely be found:
- planning my next scuba diving adventure; I'm passionate about conserving our planet, particularly marine life
- Getting out into the countryside for hiking, camping or both of those things.  
- Reading anything I can get my hands on, with special interests in psychology, history and fantasy genres
- Making the bestest banana and walnut cake. Songs will be sung about it in years to come.
