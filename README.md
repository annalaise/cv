## Annalaise Gibbons

I'm a former product owner with a passion for writing beautiful, clean code and creating awesome user experiences.

I spent my early career in marketing roles, before switching to ecommerce and eventually product. I've prototyped, launched and managed digital products at the likes of Experian, M&S.com and Nando's. I'm now moving into software development so I can combine my need to build things, with the understanding of the (hopefully brilliant) impact they will have for users.

After I graduate Maker's, I'd like to work in an environment that puts TDD at its core and stretches me to grow as a developer. Support for mentoring and pairing is key, as is a company with ethical values that wants to make grin-inducing experiences for users.

## Skills

#### I know about product (and stakeholder management)

My product experience has furnished me with a great understanding of how to build effective development teams, present and influence to all levels, and map and prioritise user stories into rewarding problems to solve.

My approach to this is holistic - is this going to work technically, now and in the future? Is it the best solution for users? What's right for the business?

I'm able to translate complex technical concepts into explanations anyone can understand, and I get a kick out of encouraging people to explore the possibilities of technology.

#### I know about agile

I've developed products in a range of frameworks - SCRUM, XP, Kanban to name a few. I strongly believe a team should choose the framework that most easily enables them collaborate, learn and ship working code.

I value spending less time in meetings, more time understanding users and building awesome solutions to their problems. Removing barriers to self and team learning is something I always strive for.

#### I know about the beauty of data

As an <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality">INTJ</a> my approach to the world is always analytical. "Does this work? How could it be better?" is an independent process I apply to all things, at all times. It's the preponent of an insatiable curiosity about new concepts, and an organised, logical approach to understanding them.

I'm a data nerd at heart and from previous marketing and product roles, I've used the following tools to help prioritise stories and build understanding of users:  

- Analytics packages including Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics and Segment
- User feedback and session monitoring tools including userzoom and tealeaf
- Multi-variant testing software including Maxymiser, Optimizely and Adobe Target. Personally I'm more of a fan of in-house non-JS solutions!
- Site performance monitoring tools including pingdom and mPulse
- Incident management tools including pagerduty   
- Data interpretation tools including MS Excel and Google Sheets
- App user feedback tools including appFigures and iOS / Google Store APIs
- Integration of the all above into Slack, because BOTS ü§ñüòç

## Interests
I'm currently teaching myself how to knit, and wrapping my head around learning to play the piano, alongside learning new programming languages.

When not cramming more things into my brain, you'll most likely find me:
- Planning my next scuba diving adventure; I grew up by the sea and I'm passionate about marine conservation.
- Getting out into the countryside for hiking, camping, or both of these things
- Finding some quiet time in yoga
- Gaming with friends
