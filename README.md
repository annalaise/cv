## Annalaise Gibbons

I'm a former product owner with an increasing passion for understanding exactly *how* to build brilliant applications, as well as the *why*.

As a self starter fresh from college, I spent my early career moving up the ranks in marketing roles, before switching to eCommerce and the user-psychology-rich world of conversion funnel optimisation. When that didn't challenge me enough, I then moved into product. Working with some awesome engineers, testers and UXers, I've prototyped, developed, launched and managed digital products at the likes of Experian, M&S.com and Nando's.

Roadmapping, building use cases, testing hypotheses and monitoring performance are things that now come naturally to me - *but* (and it's a big but) my brain is happiest when it's constantly challenged. Having always been fascinated by technology and its possibilities for learning, and after teaching myself some rudimentary HTML, CSS and Ruby and falling in love with code, I've enrolled in a selective developer bootcamp, Maker's Academy, to switch into software engineering proper.

After I graduate Maker's, I'll be looking for a role as a Junior Full Stack Developer. I'll be learning to craft clean, reusable code, with a special emphasis on TDD and pairing, so I'd like to work in an environment that echoes these values.

## Skills

#### Product and commercial experience

Since 2013, I have led digital product teams at Experian and latterly, M&S.com. In the last 7 months (to help fund my Maker's studies), I've had my freelance hat on, providing product consultancy to Nando's. These experiences has furnished me a great understanding of effective development teams, presentation and influencing skills to all levels, and how to map and prioritise user stories into rewarding challenges to tackle.

My approach to problem solving is holistic - is this going to work technically? Is it the best solution for users? What's right for the business? As a strategic thinker, I also strive to ensure solutions enable the development of potential future features or fixes, and ensure the benefits of releases are communicated effectively to all stakeholders.

#### Strong understanding of agile (what works in teams, and more importantly, what doesn't)

I've developed products in a range of agile frameworks - SCRUM, XP, Kanban to name a few. I'm not prescribed to any particular methodology, but I strongly believe a team should choose the framework that most easily enables them collaborate, learn and ship working code. In my product life, I ensured my teams calibrated our approach on a regular basis to spend less time in meetings, more time understanding users and building awesome solutions to their problems. Removing barriers to this is something I always strive for.

#### A naturally curious, analytical mind

As an <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality">INTJ</a> my approach to the world is always analytical. "Does this work? How could it be better?" is an independent process I apply to all things, at all times. It's the prepotent of an insatiable curiosity about new, as yet unthought of solutions, and an organised and efficient approach to testing them.

I'm a data nerd at heart and from previous marketing and product roles, I've used the following tools to help prioritise stories and build understanding of users:  

- Analytics packages including Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics and Segment
- User feedback and session monitoring tools including userzoom and tealeaf
- Multi-variant testing software including Maxymiser, Optimizely and Adobe Target. Personally I'm more of a fan of in-house non-JS solutions!
- Site performance monitoring tools including pingdom and mPulse
- Incident management tools including pagerduty   
- Data interpretation tools including MS Excel and Google Sheets
- App user feedback tools including appFigures and iOS / Google Store APIs
- Integration of the all above into Slack, because bots are awesome!

## Interests

In play, as in work, I love to learn new things. I'm currently teaching myself how to knit, and wrapping my head around learning the piano and reading music, alongside learning code syntax.

When not filling my brain with new things, I'll likely be found:
- Planning my next scuba diving adventure; I grew up by the sea and I'm passionate about marine conservation
- Getting out into the countryside for hiking, camping, or both of these things
- Reading anything I can get my hands on, with special interests in psychology, history and fantasy genres
- Playing exclusively medieval-focused RPGs on my Xbox 360 (yes, I'm a retro gamer)
- Making banana and walnut cake, which is frequently requested by colleagues. One cannot deny the demands of the people.
